### CAR REGISTRATION TASK

## Description

As part of a school project, we built a webpage that allows the user to register vehicle information for various cars and then search through the registrations using licence entries. The information is stored and displayed on a table, including additonal price discounts.

The project was completed by three persons.

2) Press "Add"

3) The data will display on a table on the right side of the screen, including additional discount information based on:
- 20% discount if the car value is over 20 000€
- 15% discount if the car value is between 5 000€ and 20 000€
- 10% discount if the car value is under 5 000€

4) Create more car registrations, so the table can be filled with more entries. Adding again an already registered licence is prevented, so new licences being added need to be different from one another, however other type of data can be repeated.

5) Search for a particular licence by using the search field and button. The table will display only the matching car data

6) To clear your search, you can click "Reset Search" and the table will display all data in full again. To clear all stored data in the table, you may click "Reset Table"
